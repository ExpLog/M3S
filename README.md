Multi-State System Simulation

This project is built on top of [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).

To build this project using sbt, simply run the compile command.

After running the tests, individual logs for each test suite can be found in the directory ".target\streams\test\test".
All logs reant to be read in the console, as they all contain commands for coloring the console.
